// Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.

// naive
// go through all elements and keep building up a 3 element array
// includes [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2] etc
// then at the end, check if it's a valid solution

// recursive
// a permuted array is comprised of all differently ordered elements
